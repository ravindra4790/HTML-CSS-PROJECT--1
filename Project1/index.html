                <h2>Missile man of India</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)
                     was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India

                     and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science 
                     administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) 
                     and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                      involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.

                    l role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the 
                    original nuclear test by India in 1974
